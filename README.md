This is a mobile app created for my 3rd year mobile computing module.

It is a quiz app that features a login and signup screen connected to a firebase
database. There is a main page once logged in with three levels of difficulty,
with each level needing the previous level to be completed before it is playable
(e.g. level 2 unlocks when level 1 is completed). I was also required to create
functional and non-functional user requirements, wireframes, an asset table,
a testing table and a self evaluation of the app.

What I learnt:
- how to use react
- how to use JavaScript for more complicated functions than linking firebase 
- how to structure and navigate the file structure of a mobile app in react
- how to use authentication in firebase for assigning seperate values to seperate
  user accounts

What I would do better:
- Make code more reusable and scalable (e.g. not have seperate static pages for the different levels)
- Email and password verification to ensure the user inputs emails in the correct
  format and strong enough passwords with a minimum character limit, numbers, etc. 
- Randomising the order of questions and answers are shown.
- Adding a timer to questions. The faster the user answers correctly the more points
  are added to the users score. 
- Adding a user profile with username and profile picture and add a leaderboard of
  all players high scores on main page.
- Make more engaging UI with images and effects.
